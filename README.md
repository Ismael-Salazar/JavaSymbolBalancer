# JavaSymbolBalancer

This program works by running the SymbolBalance class with a single command line argument that takes in a single text fine with code and tells the user where an imbalance of symbols occurs. I implemeneted my own stack class. The program does not work for '//' comments, but I am still attempting to find a way to make it work.
